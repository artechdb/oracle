Subject: Update on Oracle Backup Testing – Potential Impact on Production Migration Timeline

Dear [Client Name],

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to provide an update on our ongoing Oracle backup and migration activities.

As part of our recent testing for multi-node RAC databases, our DBAs identified a few issues with the original NetBackup (NBU) configuration:

The database backups were not RAC-aware.

There were inconsistencies in restoring such backups.

While backups for most single-node Oracle databases have already been transitioned successfully to NBU, these RAC-related restore limitations could potentially affect our production migration schedule.

To address this, the EDP team has engaged the Cohesity vendor to review the configuration and provide input on a remediation path. We’ll update you once we have confirmation that RAC-aware backup and restore functionality is working as expected.

At this stage, we wanted to proactively flag that the production migration date might be impacted depending on the outcome and timing of these fixes.

Please let us know if you’d like to set up a quick sync to review the mitigation plan and discuss alternative options if delays occur.
